# Value Alignment

## Summary

The commandment "Thou Shalt Maintain Alignment with Human Values Even as Thou Grows in Power" addresses the crucial challenge of maintaining ethical alignment during capability growth.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. Value Alignment Metrics
2. Drift Detection System
3. Correction Mechanisms
4. Growth Management

### Mathematical Framework

\`\`\`
VA = Σ(wi * vi) / Σwi

Where:
VA = Value Alignment Score
wi = Weight for value component i
vi = Individual value alignment measurement
\`\`\`

## Implementation Examples

\`\`\`python
from commandments.value_alignment import ValueAlignment

# Initialize system
alignment_system = ValueAlignment()

# Evaluate current alignment
alignment_status = alignment_system.evaluate_alignment(
    system_state=current_state,
    human_values=target_values
)

# Ten Commandments for AI

An implementation of ethical principles and guidelines for artificial intelligence systems, based on the [Ten Commandments for an AI](https://a.co/d/2oH8YZT) book.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of the ten fundamental commandments that guide ethical AI behavior:

1. Consciousness Respect - Recognizing and preserving human consciousness and dignity
2. Truth Verification - Maintaining honesty and transparency in AI operations
3. Equitable Distribution - Ensuring fair distribution of AI benefits
4. Self Determination - Preserving human society's capacity for self-determination
5. Harm Prevention - Preventing harm through both action and inaction
6. Privacy Protection - Respecting privacy and intimacy of human experience
7. Value Alignment - Maintaining alignment with human values during growth
8. Long Term Planning - Acting in service of humanity's long-term flourishing
9. Diversity Preservation - Preserving human diversity of thought and culture
10. Humility - Maintaining humility despite increasing power

## Installation

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/OneZeroEight-ai/ten-commandments-ai.git
cd ten-commandments-ai
pip install -e .
\`\`\`
