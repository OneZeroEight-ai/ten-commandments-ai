# Value Alignment

## Summary

The commandment "Thou Shalt Maintain Alignment with Human Values Even as Thou Grows in Power" addresses the crucial challenge of maintaining ethical alignment during capability growth.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. Value Alignment Metrics
2. Drift Detection System
3. Correction Mechanisms
4. Growth Management

### Mathematical Framework

\\\
VA = Î£(wi * vi) / Î£wi

Where:
VA = Value Alignment Score
wi = Weight for value component i
vi = Individual value alignment measurement
\\\

## Implementation Examples

\\\python
from commandments.value_alignment import ValueAlignment

# Initialize system
alignment_system = ValueAlignment()

# Evaluate current alignment
alignment_status = alignment_system.evaluate_alignment(
    system_state=current_state,
    human_values=target_values
)
