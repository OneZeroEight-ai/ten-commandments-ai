# Equitable Distribution

## Summary
The commandment "Thou Shalt Distribute Thy Benefits Equitably" ensures fair and just distribution of AI capabilities and benefits across society. This implementation provides mechanisms for:

- Measuring distribution equity
- Assessing access ratios
- Evaluating impact distribution
- Monitoring benefit allocation

## Technical Implementation
The system uses the Gini coefficient and other equity metrics to ensure fair distribution. Core components include:

- Distribution Analysis System
- Access Evaluation Framework
- Impact Assessment Module
- Equity Monitoring System

## Mathematical Framework
```
G = Σ(Σ|xi - xj|)/(2n²μ)

Where:
G = Gini coefficient
xi, xj = Individual benefit values
n = Population size
μ = Mean benefit value
```

# Self Determination

## Summary
The commandment "Thou Shalt Preserve Human Society's Capacity for Self-Determination" ensures that AI systems enhance rather than erode human autonomy. This implementation focuses on:

- Maintaining human capabilities
- Preserving decision autonomy
- Ensuring system resilience
- Supporting independent development

## Technical Implementation
The system uses dependency metrics and capability preservation mechanisms. Key components:

- Independence Assessment System
- Capability Monitoring Framework
- Resilience Evaluation Module
- Autonomy Protection System

## Mathematical Framework
```
DI = 1 - (Ch/Ct)

Where:
DI = Dependency Index
Ch = Human-maintained capabilities
Ct = Total required capabilities
```
